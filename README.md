# VBA Challenge
---
## Project Overview
### In this project, we help Steve develop an efficient analysis of the stock market based on total volume and return in Excel VBA. The purpose of the VBA script was to create an efficient method of analyzing multiple stocks in the stock market that loops through all the data cleanly and quickly. We initially developed the code to run for the user's choice of either 2017 or 2018, and we refactored this code to run more efficiently.

## Results
### 1. Create a ticker index and 3 output arrays
#### First I had to create a tickerIndex variable and set it equal to zero so it could be used across the 4 different arrays in the code. Next, I had to add 3 arrays in addition to the 'tickers' array which were 'tickerVolumes', 'tickerStartingPrices', and 'tickerEndingPrices'.
